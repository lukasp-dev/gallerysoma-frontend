## Introduction

The main purpose of this project is to make an E-commerce website that "functions" as a real E-commerce service.
Gallery SOMA, an honest art gallery that connects modern art to people, is an art gallery/organization where many desired and inspirational artists find their value. The main features of the website include picking, liking, buying, selling, registering, and showcasing the artwork.


### Why did we build this?

Before building this application, we spotted some <b>problems</b> with gallery SOMA's traditional way of selling art. 
SOMA's commercial transaction which is crucial for the well-being and improvement of the company was made only through art Exhibitions & Fairs.
Frankly speaking, we believed that SOMA wasn't utilizing its full potential by restricting its impact to only those who physically visit the SOMA gallery, exhibition, etc. Despite the promotion via Social Media Services and acquaintances, SOMA's force to drag a variety of consumers was not as impactful as expected.
it seemed obvious to us that SOMA's mission for connecting modern art to people was hardly guaranteed in SOMA's conventional business system for the following several reasons.

People nowadays(typically young generations) are

1. Uncertain of their taste: they don't have time to visit places to find their taste in art.
2. Not affordable for expensive artwork: it's often believed that visiting art galleries and fairs is a privilege exclusively for the affluent and wealthy.
3. Confused by the artist's pricing model: they sometimes do not understand why an artist's art is so expensive and they are not willing to bother themselves go to the gallery and figure it out.

We wanted to let people know that the world of art is very friendly, economical, and more accessible than they think.
The most effective way to attain this goal was to create an e-commerce website where the gallery kindly explains, shows, and introduces the world of art.
Other than these effects, the innate nature of having e-commerce would increase the accessibility of consumers from all around the world.
